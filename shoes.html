                  />These K-Swiss trainers are all kinds of colours aren't they.
                  I think they're as colourful as tropical birds. Can you
                  imagine having tropical birds as shoes?! I wonder if they
                  could still fly while carrying you. That would be great, you
                  would never have to wait for a bus again, you could just fly
                  wherever you wanted to go. I suppose rain may cause some
                  issues both for you, and your bird-trainers, as no one likes
                  to get wet in the rain really. I'm not sure how being wet
                  would affect the birds aerodynamic properties either, that's
                  definitely something to consider before using birds as
                  trainers.

                  />The title of this article on the home page says it all.
                  These nice, brown oxford shoes are somehow managing to float
                  in mid-air. There's really only one explanation, magic. I
                  think this is pretty much genuine proof that magic exists and
                  as we now have the proof, it's safe to say that Harry Potter
                  must be a true story as well. I think we'd better go and try
                  and find that door on the train station platform that he walks
                  through because I once saw one of those movies and there was a
                  street that had some great shops on it. I expect it's better
                  than any outlet village here in the UK. It's pretty much a
                  sure thing that they will have all the major designer brands
                  there as well, I have been after some Gucci sunglasses for a
                  while. Now I know there's a hidden, untapped world of shopping
                  out there I can't wait to explore it.

                    id="grey1"
                  />It would be very easy to assume that these trainers are also
                  the subject of magic, but, I think a more realistic scenario
                  is that the owner just doesn't want them any more. And can you
                  blame them? Look at their boring grey colour and strange
                  waffle pattern. I bet that traps the dirt and gets filthy so
                  quickly. One thing I would point out is the person throwing
                  them is obviously not great at sports! I mean thery appear to
                  be on a bridge of some sort and the logical thing would be to
                  throw them off the bridge. It seems they either lack the
                  physical strength to throw them that far, or they don't have
                  the throwing technique. Have you ever tried throwing something
                  with your weak arm? That's what this person throws like....you
                  can tell!!

                  />This is more like it. A nice, normal stylish photo of some
                  nice shoes. The floor looks quite shiny though and it's making
                  me worried that it's a bowling alley! The surface on a bowling
                  alley is so slippery! I bet you've seen videos of people
                  falling over on bowling alleys on YouTube or some other site.
                  I have a genuine concern for the owner of these shoes that
                  they're going to try and use them for bowling. That's so
                  unsafe! I suppose the only upside to all of this is that once
                  they've fallen over and someone has filmed it and put it on
                  the internet, at least people will comment on how nice their
                  shoes are.
