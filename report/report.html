    <h1>Web Development Project Report</h1>
    <h2>Toby Box</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to create a topical magazine website that focusses on footwear,
      watches and men's style. I chose this as my subject as I wanted to work on
      something that interests me and allows me to really try and create a
      connection with visitors to the website. The aim was to take visitors on a
      journey from footwear, through watches, to complete outfits across the
      five pages, so it followed a logical sequence and each page built on the
      previous. For each page I aimed to use something slightly different as a
      main feature, but I wanted the style to be consistent across the site and
      the theme and colour scheme to remain constant. I was very keen that the
      style of the page match the subject and conveyed an upmarket and
      classically stylish image. When considering the structure for the website
      I wanted to try and make the website flow easily from one page to the
      next, so I decided to use five individual pages and not have sub-pages. I
      feel that a linear structure aids navigation and keeps the format simple,
      allowing users to navigate through the site easily and in a logical order.
      As the website is limited to five pages, I felt that a hierarchical
      structure would overly complicate the site and would inhibit the flow and
      the navigation journey I wanted to promote.
    </p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      A few years ago, I made a big career decision and to celebrate and mark
      the occasion I bought a nice watch and some nice shoes. Since then I have
      become more and more interested in men's style, with a particular focus on
      watches and footwear. When the final project topic was released, I saw it
      as the perfect opportunity to work on a subject I enjoyed as a topical
      magazine website. I follow a number of YouTube channels, Mr Porter, He
      Spoke Style, You're Terrific and Watch Collecting Strategy to name a few.
      Each of those channels has a unique style and I was inspired to create my
      website to be cool, stylish and in keeping with the theme and subject. I
      browsed websites for inspiration and Sneakers-Magazine.com was perhaps my
      biggest inspiration for layout. I liked the clean look of the pictures and
      how the picture tiles had no border and the text was placed outside the
      image. I decided to replicate that on my home page but change the colour
      scheme. The layout of Mr Porters journal section and the Permanent Style
      website were a real inspiration for how to format my articles and images
      and I felt that the fonts and colours reflected a very 'grown up' subject.
      I didn't copy the colour schemes, but I liked how the contrast of text and
      articles worked so I tried to implement a similar contrast on my website.
      I also watched a number of interesting videos on YouTube about website
      design but one that stuck out to me was "1 design trend in 2022 that I
      think will be BIG! (7 examples)" by DesignCourse. I didn't copy any one
      thing from the video, but it gave me inspiration to try new things such as
      scroll effects, picture enlargement and filter menus. Those three areas of
      inspiration really formed the visual design of my website and helped me
      create an individual style that I felt matched the subject matter.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <div>
      I have taken a number of steps to ensure accessibility in my website. The
      3 main ways my site is accessible are:
      <ol>
        <li>
          I have used clear alt text for images to ensure screen readers can
          understand exactly what the image is portraying.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have ensured that I use relative text sizes and accounted for
          resizing text when changing screen sizes. This enables the text to
          scale depending on the other content of the page and the page size. I
          have also ensured that when a user zooms in to the page the text is
          still readable.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have ensured that the site is keyboard friendly and users are able
          to 'tab' around the pages with ease. I have achieved this by using
          focus in some areas and ensuring that articles are linked by 'a href'
          elements to aid navigation.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>
      When creating my website, usability was extremely important to me and I
      aimed to achieve it across three main areas, Navigation, Content Clarity
      and Responsiveness. When looking at navigation I decided a simple, linear
      structure for the website would ensure all the content was easily
      available in a clear, logical order for the website users. I made the
      navigation bar common to all pages and made sure that the menu headings
      reacted when scrolled over, by using the hover property in CSS. Visually
      seeing a change in colour and underline means that it is very easy to see
      which menu item you are selecting. This was applied to both the navigation
      bar and the footer menu to ensure parity and consistency. When creating my
      content I wanted to ensure that not only the style reflected the subject
      but that the content was clear and easy to see and read. I picked fonts
      and colours that I knew stood out and created contrast to enhance viewing.
      I picked images that were in keeping with the style of the website but
      also were clear, well photographed and unambiguous. I kept text outside of
      articles to a minimum to aid in scanning the website and made sure that
      the layout drew the users eyes to the main content. While looking at
      responsiveness my goal was to add to the accessibility of the site while
      making sure that it still maintained it's style and image when looked at
      on different screen sizes. One area that I focussed heavily on was the
      navigation menu and ensuring that at the appropriate screen size it turned
      to a hamburger menu. This achieved two things, the menu was easy to use as
      I included the exact same heading and animations highlighting the selected
      item, and, hamburger menus are familiar as they are widely used so I added
      that comfort and familiarity to the website.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Flex box Use <br />
          Although the lectures briefly touched on Flexbox as a tool for laying
          out webpages, I found that I really needed to learn more myself to
          effectively use it in my website. I undertook the Udemy Web
          Development course concurrently to the lectures and it really helped
          me understand the specifics of Flexbox. I was able to then plan and
          construct my pages with a much better understanding of how the flex
          display property worked and how parent and child elements reacted
          based on their Flexbox settings. I felt that I used grid display in
          appropriate areas but really harnessed the power of Flexbox to create
          the majority of my website. I practiced often by creating simple pages
          with coloured boxes to learn how the different properties affected the
          layout and then applied what I had seen to my own website. A great
          example of this was when creating the Watches page, I was having some
          difficulty with how the articles were positioning themselves so
          created a simple, coloured boxes webpage and practiced using different
          Flexbox settings to get the right layout. I then transferred the
          settings to my page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hamburger menu creation <br />
          I knew at a very early stage that I wanted a hamburger menu in my
          mobile version of the site and I think it is familiar, current and
          stylish when using a mobile device or smaller screen. I found that a
          hamburger menu was a particularly difficult object to create with
          little experience in Web Design. I tried multiple YouTube tutorials
          for information and guidance on how to create the menu and settled on
          the framework from a YouTube video by Kevin Powell titled "Create a
          responsive navigation nav with no JS!". I then adapted the basics of
          the layout and method to suit my theme, colour scheme and menu items.
          I found it very difficult to work out how to size and place my menu in
          the exact position I wanted and not affect its action when in
          responsive mode or using smaller screens. I tried many different
          settings and this also helped me explore more CSS properties and gain
          a greater understanding of how everything fit and worked together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Picture resize functionality <br />
          I wanted to have the ability to click on a picture to enlarge it and
          realised early on the Javascript was the easiest way to achieve this
          functionality. I managed to work out, by myself, how to apply it to
          the main article image on my home page using DOM functions and
          buttons. I tried a number of different CSS properties to make sure the
          image had the correct presentation and position. I couldn't work out
          how to apply my enlargeImg() function to multiple images so decided to
          try a different system for the Shoes and Boots pages. I asked a
          question on StackOverflow about my enlargeImg() function and was
          signposted to a previous topic and code solution. I used this code
          snippet as the basis of my page and then inserted it into the main
          section of my webpages. This allowed me to have the same header and
          footer but have a new structure within the main element of the body.
          This did mean I had to work through a number of problems caused by
          inherited properties which needed to be accounted for in the new code
          for it to work. I learned a lot about how to use existing code and
          refactor it to suit my ideas. The new structure for the Shoes and
          Boots pages now focussed on a series of expandable boxes which allowed
          me to use the Javascript function to enlarge the pictures across all
          the images. It was a very interesting problem to work through and I
          learned about containers and expandable elements and how to use event
          listeners to control them. This was perhaps the most difficult problem
          I worked through but also the most interesting.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>Evaluation I</h3>
    <p>
      I think that the style, colours and theme of the website work well. I feel
      that they give a feeling of sophistication in keeping with a stylish
      menswear site. My menu system works well, and I think that the way it
      switches from a nav bar to a hamburger menu is well coded and responds
      well at various screen sizes. I am happy with the different methods of
      enlarging pictures that I have used; I feel that they bring some extra
      depth and complexity to the website. I am pleased with my Javascript
      functionality, I think the combination of self-written and refactored code
      adds some great effects to the website and enhances the user experience. I
      am pleased that I had already completed both Introduction to Programming
      modules prior to this course as the background Javascript knowledge really
      helped me understand some of the more difficult concepts. Along with the
      Javascript, I feel that the use of flex and grid layouts is appropriate
      and at the right level to enhance the website. It's a fairly simple design
      and I feel that my use of different layout systems ensures that the
      responsiveness and usability of the site is at the required standard.
    </p>

    <h3>Evaluation II</h3>
    <p>
      I think the majority of areas I feel that could be improved are as a
      result of the structure of the website. For example, I found sizing the
      embedded YouTube videos difficult and I feel that I could investigate
      better ways to implement those. While creating the website, as I decided
      on adding extra usability, I found that in order to either apply a new
      effect, or to use refactored code, I needed to change the structure and
      add new elements. This caused me many problems with inherited properties,
      and I spent a lot of time manipulating existing code to ensure the new
      effects worked and did not change the layout. I want to learn more about
      how properties are inherited and also about how functions bubble up in
      Javascript and I will become more familiar with the developer tools at my
      disposal to help with that. In the future, now I have learned a great deal
      about the design and how to implement various effects, I would structure
      my webpages differently and be more meticulous in my planning. I used
      Flexbox as the main display layout for my website as it seemed easier to
      work with and more powerful, but, looking at the structure of my website I
      feel that I could've made more use of grid and it would've perhaps been
      easier to work with. I decided against using bootstrap as I didn't feel it
      would give me any enhanced functionality but in the future I would
      definitely look at how to incorporate other frameworks.
