                This is a really large bit of text to fill. I suppose the first
                thing we could say is that the moonwatch went to the moon. That
                is if you believe man went to the moon! It could be that the
                guys just got together after a night out and decided to film
                themselves pretending to be astronauts. I mean, it's not that
                hard to knock up a realistic costume with a bit of bulky winter
                clothing, if you look closely on the moon landing videos you can
                actually see that one of them is wearing wellington boots that
                he's clearly got out of his winter clothing cupboard. It's more
                likely that they went out on the town and wanted to dress up
                nice and lets be honest, the speedmaster is a realy, really nice
                watch and that's probably why it ended up in the footage.
                <img
                  class="watch-img"
                  id="watch1"

                  alt="Omega speedmaster watch"
                />I mean, if it were real then they would absolutely have a
                digital watch with giant numbers on that gave them all kinds of
                info wouldn't they. Not a versatile, dressy but sporty watch
                that looks great in multiple outfits. These are the questions I
                ask myself really. I'm fairly certain at one point in the moon
                landings footage you can see Neil Armstrong's mum come in saying
                she's made them some late night snacks and also to tell them to
                remember to take their shoes off before coming upstairs.

                Now this is a classic watch. There simply is not a better watch
                to say to the world that yuo've made it. That being said, it's
                got a much more practical history than people are aware of. The
                fluted bezel, although pretty and appearing to be decorative,
                actually acts as a very small saw, you can see it's ridged. If
                you are kidnapped its the perfect way to cut through rope used
                to tie your wrists. Or maybe there's been high winds and some of
                the trees in your garden are looking a bit precarious, don't be
                scared of damaging the soft, gold metal of the bezel, just go
                for it and cut through those tree trunks. You'll be through them
                in no time.

                  alt="2nd image of Rolex datejust watch"
                />Ask anyone who wears this type of watch bracelet, they are so
                good at pulling hairs out of your arms. That's because they are
                actually based on a design for a hair removal tool that was
                created by the ancient greeks. So next time you're about to pay
                for a wax or hair removal, dont! Just get your Rolex out and rub
                it all over yourself, you'll be hairless in minutes and,
                honestly, it doesn't hurt at all!

                What sort of name is Patek Philippe? Is that last name first or
                what? Is the owners name Philippe Patek but they didn't like how
                that rolled off the tongue? I don't know that answer to that
                question but what I do know is, this watch is possibly the
                greatest watch ever made and I want one! It's a shame that at
                the current prices they cost a shade over the price it costs to
                launch a rocket into space. And I mean a big rocket, not one of
                those ones that you see rocket enthusiasts playing with or the
                ones that the Jackass crew use to launch each other into lakes.

                some kind of magical power. Wait. Maybe it's these people who
                are making all those shoes float on the shoe page? I'll bet
                that's it isn't it! It's not Harry Potter after all, it's
                Philippe Patek, or Patek Philippe or whatever the hell his name
                is!
