                  />These brown brogue boots are very nice. They appear to be
                  sitting on a pile of other shoes and one has to wonder, whos
                  shoes are they? What has happened to the people that were
                  wearing them? Were they abducted by aliens....? That seems
                  like an unlikely scenario but in today's crazy world you just
                  never know. One minute they were here and the next they were
                  gone. They probably left family and possessions behind. I
                  mean, what happened to the food in their fridges? It's
                  probably gone off by now and smells pretty bad; I feel sorry
                  for their neighbours if I'm honest.

                  <br />
                  They are a nice shade of brown though, kinda like chestnut.
                  Ooohhh I do love a roasted chestnut don't you? They are so
                  festive and are a real treat on a cold winters night with a
                  cup of mulled wine or something similar. I bet they take a bit
                  of polishing though to keep in good condition. Just like any
                  shoes and boots really. Gotta look after these things or they
                  won't last as long.

                  />I sometimes wonder if a black double monkstrap boot is a bit
                  pretentious, don't you? I mean there aren't many things you
                  could really wear them with. You definitely could not wear
                  them with shorts. Can you imagine how crazy that would look?
                  Taking a lovely stroll on a hot, sandy beach in paradise with
                  a lovely cool linen shirt on and some lovely tailored shorts.
                  You're on your way to get a nice cocktail to start your
                  evening and maybe you're wearing a nice panama hat, some cool
                  sunglasses and then people look at your feet and you're
                  wearing entirely inapproriate footwear! It would really spoilt
                  the image so my suggestion to you is that black double
                  monkstrap boots are saved for occassions that require smart
                  trousers! Save yourself the funny looks!

                  really is designed for people who are out in the hills or
                  mountains, or maybe people in construction or timber yards,
                  that kind of thing. <br /><br />
                  That is, unless you live in London and you want to look really
                  cool and edgy and pretend to all your friends that you're a
                  real fashion trendsetter! If that's you then buy these boots
                  and then pair them with some corduroy trousers, a plaid shirt
                  over a white T-Shirt and the tightest woolly hat you can find.
                  If you can add round sunglasses then you're really going to
                  impress your mates.

                  />So, these boots are super nice. I have some almost exactly
                  like them and I also wear turned up jeans with them. I'd never
                  worn turned up jeans before and if I'm honest, I wasn't really
                  sure it was a look I wanted to go with. Do you know what? Now
                  I wouldn't wear jeans without a turn up. It's just such a
                  stylish look and with a nice pair of selvedge denim and nice
                  boots like this, it's an absolute winning combo! This person
                  appears to be walking in a park or some other tree dense area
                  in autumn, lovely. Just watch out for the hidden dog poo under
                  the leaves really, that's all I can say!

                    class="footwear-image"
                  />I'm actually wondering if this person knows how to tie boot
                  laces really. I mean, they seem to be doing an ok job but I'm
                  not sure if they would stayed laced up curing rigourous
                  activity, chasing a badger for instance. I'll bet that can get
                  quite intense and the last thing I'd want when faced by an
                  angry badger is for my bootlace to come undone and cause a
                  trip hazard. That would be no joke and a serious health and
                  safety hazard, both for me and the badger. Can you imagine if
                  you fell on a badger and injured it, I suppose if you were in
                  conflict with it though it would be a kind of win. But I hear
                  the best way to deal with an agry badger is to sing to it
                  anyway so maybe it'd be best to ensure your boots are properly
                  laced up in the first place.
